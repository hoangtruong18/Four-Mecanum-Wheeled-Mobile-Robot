# About this project
This project uses microcontroller Adruino MEGA 2560 board and 4 Motor & 9 Servo motor driver board (which can drive 4 motors with two IC TB6612), especially this project uses ESP8266 for controlling the Mecanum wheel robot wirelessly. So we can improve and develop this project by combining the Computer Vision technology and http requests from URL for further function such as tracking control using camera and applying control theory algorithms.

# Requirements
Download Adruino IDE.

Download CH340 or CP210 Driver to get the COM port in Adruino IDE for uploading code.

Installing ESP8266 Board in Arduino IDE.

Pycharm or Python with Visual Studio Code.

All the libraries used in the project.
